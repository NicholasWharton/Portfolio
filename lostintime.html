    <p>
      The 3D Lost In Time game was made for the Quantum Leap project at the Academy High School.
      This game was programmed by me but the majority of art was found online.
      The game was based in two time periods Ancient Egypt, and Rome.
      Lost in Time included enemies such as Egyptian mummies, and Roman skeletons.
      The game was created using the game engine Unreal Engine 4, and their programming language Blueprint.
      This helps with my future carrers because it gives me more tools that I will be able to use.
