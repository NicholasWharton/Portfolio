    <p>
      STEAM is an acronym that stands for science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics.
      This is one of the main principles that the Academy focuses on.
      Project based Interdisciplinary learning is the other main principle that is followed.
      This means that all of our learning is done through projects where all of our subjects are pulled in to create one cohesive final deliverable.
      The reason why i came to the academy was because of the projects.
      My time at the academy has really helped developed skills such as teamwork, a programming that i will use in my future.
